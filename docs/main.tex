		For my first project, the company provides global distribution services to airline companies. These distributions of data products are in the area of the travel industry. \\

		The team I'm in is in the department of airline ticket reservation. My role (platform engineer) is to support internal teams to deliver the global distribution data to external customers. The orchestration of the jobs are managed through Jenkins (using Groovy as a choice of scripting language). Jenkins runs on CentOS 7 in company data centers, with OS patch management automated using Ansible. \\
		The data processing is managed by AWS EMR clusters. Due to policy restrictions, the artifacts are stored in S3 bucket and the retrieval of them, depending on the provided release or PR version is made by a custom bash script, that gets called for every job that contain a dependency list file. \\ \\

		My contributions to the project currently include: \\
		- migrated a legacy Groovy pipeline script to the internal Groovy framework, which automatically handles all application lifecycles: build, test, release, and deploy. \\
		- rewritten and changed the logic of the feed framework from Bash to Python for delivering data to customers on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, with partial or full deliveries. \\
		- introduced a new approach to build a development environment for specific applications by using Nix devenv. With having only nix installed, the required dependencies (Python, Groovy, S3 on Localstack) are defined in a .nix file and are automatically installed and available by just entering the project root directory. \\
		-  developed a custom script to automatically switch EMR instances from spot to on-demand if jobs wait more than 15 minutes, optimizing costs \\

	\textbf{Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)} \\
	\textit{DevOps Engineer (AWS)}

	My initial project focused on the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for a multinational automotive company. \\
	Within this project, my role was working as a DevOps Engineer on AWS cloud infrastructure management,
	where we were responsible for maintaining the entire cloud platform, including the deployment of
	customer products with the help of AWS ADF framework, AWS Account-Vending-Machine and AWS Control Tower custom REST API. \\

	The automation of these processes was achieved through the use of AWS CDK Infrastructure as Code (IaaC). \\

	As part of my contributions to client services, I implemented the following solutions: \\
	- budget cost alerting on the entire platform with predefined percentage of exceeded budget to fire off email messages to the Business Owners \\
	- creating additional REST API endpoints for the Control Tower for specifying which newly created AWS accounts belong to which VPC.
	In there I also wrote the logic where a Lambda Function checks the type of account and based on which VPC template it belongs to - deploys the AWS CloudFormation StackSet to the appropriate account. \\
	- creating a High level design of data flow and replication for the entire Data platform \\

	\textbf{Food industry} \\
	\textit{DevOps/Data Engineer (Azure)}

	My second project revolved around delivering valuable insights to enhance
	the shopping experience for customers and establishing loyalty programs for a renowned Whole Foods store company. \\
	I was positioned as Data Engineer on the Azure platform for ensuring data integrity and data validation on the
	Raw to Source to Prepared Layer. For data validation processes, we developed a Test Automation Framework built upon the pytest framework. \\
