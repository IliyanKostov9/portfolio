"I have started on my engineering journey back when I was a kid and had to "
"constantly fix our family desktop computer from crashing on WindowsXP and "
"Windows7, where the issue might be either hardware related - ROM failed, "
"motherboard got fried because of the very hot summers we had at the late "
"2000s, or I installed a pirated game with additional content (aka malware). "
"That repetition of breaking and fixing changed my way of thinking and "
"approaching problems from there on."

"Afterward I joined in a high school for operation of road transport. Yes, "
"it's not computer related, but it's in the engineering field. I actually do "

"Time passed by and then after high school I was working at a grocery store "
"and like every confused 18 years old, I was wondering what I was going to do "
"with my life. Then after looking of all the local Varna universities, I then "
"stopped at this one, called *Technical university of Varna*. I got curious "
"by the technical specialtes - mainly at computer science and computer "
"technologies and internet. After a bit of thinking, I randomly choose the "
"second option. That was by far the <span class=\"green\">best</span> life "
"changing choice I've made so far and at that time I couldn't have imagined "
"how much this decision was going to change me for the better."

"In there I didn't learn only about technology, I learnt about working with "
"others, exchanging ideas with passionate people, engaging in debates with "
"professors and assitants, and most importantly - becoming an adult. That's "
"the point of an university, shaping you into a well-rounded individual, who "
"can be integrated into the professional and social environments and being "
"responsible for their actions. I concretely believe in that statement. I've "
"heard so many pepole (co-students), that believe that the point of an "
"university is to get a job, that person is either delusional or being a "
"stubborn child, that doesn't want to look at the bigger picture."

"In the third year of my bachelor's degree (2021) I was in an internship of a "
"small local financial institution, that we developed legacy Windows 32bit "
"for WindowsXP systems in Visual Objects community edition (also called "
"CAVO). In the same year I landed my first actual IT job as a DevOps engineer "
"as a consultant. The good thing about being a consultant is that you can see "
"different companies (clients) with different architectures and <i>ways-of-"
"working</i> in a very short amount of time, but the bad part is that you are "
"not a permanent employee in these projects and you'll have to learn all of "
"those tedious company's processes and in-house tools again for the next "
"project. Believe me, in time you'll get very irritated by it."

"After some time I've spend working there and becoming more familiar with the "
"company, I started to dislike the the company culture and decided to go "
"elsewhere. In May 2025, I found another job, which wasn't just a job, but a "
"life change. I had to move out to live on the southern region of France, "
"Côte d'Azur."
