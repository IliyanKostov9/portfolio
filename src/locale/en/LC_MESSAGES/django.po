"      I have started on my engineering journey back when I was a kid and had "
"to\n"
"      constantly fix our family desktop computer from crashing on WindowsXP "
"and\n"
"      Windows7, where the issue might be either hardware related - ROM "
"failed,\n"
"      motherboard got fried because of the very hot summers we had at the "
"late\n"
"      2000s, or I installed a pirated game with additional content (aka\n"
"      malware). That repetition of breaking and fixing changed my way of\n"
"      thinking and approaching problems from there on.\n"

"      Yes, it's not computer related, but it's in the engineering field. I\n"

"      Time passed by and then after high school I was working at a grocery\n"
"      store and like every confused 18 years old, I was wondering what I "
"was\n"
"      going to do with my life. Then after looking of all the local Varna\n"
"      universities, I then stopped at this one, called *Technical "
"university\n"
"      of Varna*. I got curious by the technical specialtes - mainly at\n"
"      computer science and computer technologies and internet. After a bit "
"of\n"
"      thinking, I randomly choose the second option. That was by far the\n"
"      <span class=\"green\">best</span> life changing choice I've made so "
"far\n"
"      and at that time I couldn't have imagined how much this decision was\n"
"      going to change me for the better.\n"

"      In there I didn't learn only about technology, I learnt about working\n"
"      with others, exchanging ideas with passionate people, engaging in\n"
"      debates with professors and assitants, and most importantly - "
"becoming\n"
"      an adult. That's the point of an university, shaping you into a\n"
"      well-rounded individual, who can be integrated into the professional "
"and\n"
"      social environments and being responsible for their actions. I\n"
"      concretely believe in that statement. I've heard so many pepole\n"
"      (co-students), that believe that the point of an university is to get "
"a\n"
"      job, that person is either delusional or being a stubborn child, that\n"
"      doesn't want to look at the bigger picture.\n"

"      In the third year of my bachelor's degree (2021) I was in an "
"internship\n"
"      of a small local financial institution, that we developed legacy "
"Windows\n"
"      32bit for WindowsXP systems in Visual Objects community edition (also\n"
"      called CAVO). In the same year I landed my first actual IT job as a\n"
"      DevOps engineer as a consultant. The good thing about being a "
"consultant\n"
"      is that you can see different companies (clients) with different\n"
"      architectures and <i>ways-of-working</i> in a very short amount of "
"time,\n"
"      but the bad part is that you are not a permanent employee in these\n"
"      projects and you'll have to learn all of those tedious company's\n"
"      processes and in-house tools again for the next project. Believe me, "
"in\n"
"      time you'll get very irritated by it.\n"
