      As you may have already guessed from the title above, my name is indeed
      Iliyan. I'm born in Bulgaria in a city on the coast of the Black Sea -
      Varna.

      I have started on my engineering journey back when I was a kid and had to
      constantly fix our family desktop computer from crashing on WindowsXP and
      Windows7, where the issue might be either hardware related - ROM failed,
      motherboard got fried because of the very hot summers we had at the late
      2000s, or I installed a pirated game with additional content (aka
      malware). That repetition of breaking and fixing changed my way of
      thinking and approaching problems from there on.

        Afterward I joined in a high school for operation of road transport.
        Yes, it's not computer related, but it's in the engineering field. I
        actually do consider myself more of an <u>engineer</u> than a computer
        scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time passed by and then after high school I was working at a grocery
        store and like every confused 18 years old, I was wondering what I was
        going to do with my life. Then after looking of all the local Varna
        universities, I then stopped at this one, called *Technical university
        of Varna*. I got curious by the technical specialtes - mainly at
        computer science and computer technologies and internet. After a bit of
        thinking, I randomly choose the second option. That was by far the
        <span class="p-green">best</span> life changing choice I've made so
        far and at that time I couldn't have imagined how much this decision was
        going to change me for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        In there I didn't learn only about technology, I learnt about working
        with others, exchanging ideas with passionate people, engaging in
        debates with professors and assitants, and most importantly - becoming
        an adult. That's the point of an university, shaping you into a
        well-rounded individual, who can be integrated into the professional and
        social environments and being responsible for their actions. I
        concretely believe in that statement. I've heard so many pepole
        (co-students), that believe that the point of an university is to get a
        job, that person is either delusional or being a stubborn child, that
        doesn't want to look at the bigger picture.

        In the third year of my bachelor's degree (2021) I was in an internship
        of a small local financial institution, that we developed legacy Windows
        32bit for WindowsXP systems in Visual Objects community edition (also
        called CAVO). In the same year I landed my first actual IT job as a
        DevOps engineer as a consultant. The good thing about being a consultant
        is that you can see different companies (clients) with different
        architectures and <i>ways-of-working</i> in a very short amount of time,
        but the bad part is that you are not a permanent employee in these
        projects and you'll have to learn all of those tedious company's
        processes and in-house tools again for the next project. Believe me, in
        time you'll get very irritated by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some time I've spend working there and becoming more familiar with
        the company, I started to dislike the the company culture and decided to
        go elsewhere. In May 2025, I found another job, which wasn't just a job,
        but a life change. I had to move out to live on the southern region of
        France, CÃ´te d'Azur.
